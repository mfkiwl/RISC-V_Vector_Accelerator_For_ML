### Description

Chaining is a method used in vector processors to speedup computational speed. It is similar to data forwarding in a classic scalar processor, where the results generated by an execution (ALU or memory), can be passed on to another execution unit next cycle immediately, bypassing the register file writeback.

### Implementation

For chaining to be possible, 2 instructions should come directly after each other, and the destination register of the old should be a source register of the new instruction (e.g. `vadd.vv v1,v2,v3` followed by `vsub.vv v4,v5,v1`). For our implementation, we used a variable ‘age’ for each of the 2 execution lanes, and checked the conditions (stated above) for chaining to be possible. This controller then outputs mux select signals which will tell each execution unit where to get its operands from: the other ALU lane, memory or register file.
