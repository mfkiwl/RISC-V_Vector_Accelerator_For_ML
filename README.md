# Arrow: A Configurable RISC-V Vector Accelerator for Machine Learning

  RISC-V implementation of a vector accelerator that will eventually be used to accelerate Machine Learning algorithms. We are compliant with latest version of the [RISC-V Vector ISA](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec) (currently v0.9).
  We plan on supporting special types such as bfloat16 and posits to accelerate these workloads.
  
  More details can be found in our [report](https://github.com/imadassir/RISC-V_Vector_Accelerator_For_ML/blob/master/Reports/FYP_final_report.pdf).
